## Robotic Arms
### Hardware
- [**Low-Cost Robot Arm**](https://github.com/AlexanderKoch-Koch/low_cost_robot) - This repository contains the files to build and control a low-cost robot arm that costs about $250. Such a robot arm is well-suited for robot learning. Two of those arms are also capable of folding clothes.
- [**Low-Cost Robot Arm: Koch v1.1**](https://github.com/jess-moss/koch-v1-1) - A version 1.1 of the Alexander Koch low-cost robot arm with some small changes.
- [**moss-robot-arms**](https://github.com/jess-moss/moss-robot-arms) - A repository for affordable, easy-to-assemble robot arms designed for teleoperation applications.
- [**SO-ARM100**](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) - Standard Open Arm 100.

### Frameworks
- [**ROS2**](https://github.com/ros2/ros2) - The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications.
- [**dora-rs**](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora) - DORA (Dataflow-Oriented Robotic Architecture) is middleware designed to streamline and simplify the creation of AI-based robotic applications.
- [**AimRT**](https://github.com/AimRT/AimRT) - AimRT is a basic runtime framework for the field of modern robotics. It is developed based on modern C++, is lightweight and easy to deploy, and has more modern designs in resource management and control, asynchronous programming, deployment configuration, etc.
